- **Interactive dashboard visualization** (via BI tool — e.g. Power BI / similar): total/average sales, item-type revenue, outlet establishment trends, outlet-type performance, and product-type breakdowns.  
- **Business-ready insights & recommendations**, enabling data-driven decisions on:  
  - Inventory and product prioritization

## 📉 Key Insights from Dashboard  

- **Total & Average Sales** provide a quick snapshot of revenue and order value.  
- **Item-type revenue breakdown** reveals the most profitable categories (e.g. Snacks, Dairy, Frozen, Household goods).  
- **Outlet growth trend over time** helps track expansion reach by location tier & size.  
- **Outlet performance comparison** — outlet types vs sales volume, items sold, average rating, item visibility.  
- **Product-type & Fat-Content analysis** supports inventory and nutritional/health-based inventory decisions.  

These insights combined help optimize operations, inventory planning, outlet management, and product strategy.
